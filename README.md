This project was developed for Bank GoodCredit to support risk management by estimating the credit score of current credit card holders.

The goal was to classify customers based on their repayment behavior:

Bad_label = 0 → Indicates a reliable credit history

Bad_label = 1 → Flags a customer with poor repayment history
